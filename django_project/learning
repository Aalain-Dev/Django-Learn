<!-- python manage.py makemigrations: -->
What is this?
1. This used to create new migration files based on the changes you made to your Django models (in models.py files).

Here's what it does:
1. Detects changes in your models (like adding a new field, creating a new model, deleting or renaming something).

2. Generates a migration file inside the migrations/ folder of your Django app.

3. That migration file contains Python code that tells Django how to update your database schema to match your models.
